# Webhooks System with ASP.NET, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ

## Overview

This project demonstrates a fully functional Webhooks system built using **ASP.NET Core**, **PostgreSQL** as the database, and **RabbitMQ** as the message broker. It is designed to handle high-performance, scalable, and efficient webhook delivery, ensuring that webhooks can be processed reliably and asynchronously.

Key Features:
- **ASP.NET Core** Web API for webhook handling and processing
- **PostgreSQL** for storing webhook events, logs, and related data
- **RabbitMQ** for message queuing, ensuring asynchronous message processing and scalability
- Optimized for **performance**, **scalability**, and **reliability** in real-world production environments

---

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: For creating the Web API and business logic
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing data related to webhook events, logs, and subscriptions
- **RabbitMQ**: For handling message queuing and ensuring asynchronous, scalable processing
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application (optional, but recommended for easier deployment)
- **Entity Framework Core**: For database interaction and ORM

---

## Features

- **Webhook Subscription**: Clients can subscribe to specific webhooks and receive notifications via HTTP POST when events are triggered.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Webhook events are processed via RabbitMQ to ensure scalability and reliability under high loads.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Webhook events and logs are stored in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring data persistence and easy auditing.
- **Scalability**: The system is designed to scale horizontally, allowing for additional API servers or workers as needed.
- **High Performance**: Optimized database and message queue operations ensure minimal latency and high throughput.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Docker** (optional but recommended for setting up PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ quickly)
2. **.NET 6.0 SDK** or higher
3. **PostgreSQL** instance running
4. **RabbitMQ** instance running

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webhook-system.git
    cd webhook-system
    ```

2. **Set up the PostgreSQL database**:
   
   - Create a PostgreSQL database (use Docker to set it up easily if needed):
     ```bash
     docker run --name webhook-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
     ```
   
   - Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to match your PostgreSQL setup.

3. **Set up RabbitMQ**:

   - You can run RabbitMQ using Docker as well:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 --name rabbitmq rabbitmq:management
     ```
   
   - Update the RabbitMQ connection settings in `appsettings.json`.

4. **Run the application**:

    - After configuring your database and RabbitMQ, you can run the application locally:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    The Web API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Performance and Scalability Considerations

- **Asynchronous Message Processing**: Webhook events are queued in RabbitMQ and processed asynchronously, ensuring that the system can handle a high volume of webhook requests without overloading the API servers.
- **Database Optimizations**: PostgreSQL is optimized with indexing and appropriate data types to ensure fast read/write operations under heavy load.

---

## Running in Production

- **Dockerize the app**: The system can be containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
  
- **Docker Compose**: Use `docker-compose` to spin up the entire environment, including the app, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
